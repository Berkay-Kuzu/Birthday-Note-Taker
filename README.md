# Birthday-Note-Taker

This is a basic Birthday Note Taker app built with User Defaults as a data source. The users can write the name and the birthday of their family or friends and save this data to the app. After terminating the app, the data saved to the app can be shown in the screen. Also, the users can deleted the data they want easily just by clicking delete button. In order to form this app, I used label, text field, and button.
